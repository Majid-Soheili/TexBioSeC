     abstract={A variety of microbial communities and their genes (the microbiome) exist throughout the human body, with fundamental roles in human health and disease. The National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded Human Microbiome Project Consortium has established a population-scale framework to develop metagenomic protocols, resulting in a broad range of quality-controlled resources and data including standardized methods for creating, processing and interpreting distinct types of high-throughput metagenomic data available to the scientific community. Here we present resources from a population of 242 healthy adults sampled at 15 or 18 body sites up to three times, which have generated 5,177 microbial taxonomic profiles from 16S ribosomal RNA genes and over 3.5 terabases of metagenomic sequence so far. In parallel, approximately 800 reference strains isolated from the human body have been sequenced. Collectively, these data represent the largest resource describing the abundance and variety of the human microbiome, while providing a framework for current and future studies.},

    abstract = "{One of the main challenges in applying machine learning algorithms to biological sequence data is how to numerically represent a sequence in a numeric input vector. Feature extraction techniques capable of extracting numerical information from biological sequences have been reported in the literature. However, many of these techniques are not available in existing packages, such as mathematical descriptors. This paper presents a new package, MathFeature, which implements mathematical descriptors able to extract relevant numerical information from biological sequences, i.e. DNA, RNA and proteins (prediction of structural features along the primary sequence of amino acids). MathFeature makes available 20 numerical feature extraction descriptors based on approaches found in the literature, e.g. multiple numeric mappings, genomic signal processing, chaos game theory, entropy and complex networks. MathFeature also allows the extraction of alternative features, complementing the existing packages. To ensure that our descriptors are robust and to assess their relevance, experimental results are presented in nine case studies. According to these results, the features extracted by MathFeature showed high performance (0.6350–0.9897, accuracy), both applying only mathematical descriptors, but also hybridization with well-known descriptors in the literature. Finally, through MathFeature, we overcame several studies in eight benchmark datasets, exemplifying the robustness and viability of the proposed package. MathFeature has advanced in the area by bringing descriptors not available in other packages, as well as allowing non-experts to use feature extraction techniques.}",

    abstract = "{Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology enables identification of microbial genomes from massive amount of human microbiomes more rapidly and cheaper than ever before. However, the traditional sequential genome analysis algorithms, tools, and platforms are inefficient for performing large-scale metagenomic studies on ever-growing sample data volumes. Currently, there is an urgent need for scalable analysis pipelines that enable harnessing all the power of parallel computation in computing clusters and in cloud computing environments. We propose ViraPipe, a scalable metagenome analysis pipeline that is able to analyze thousands of human microbiomes in parallel in tolerable time. The pipeline is tuned for analyzing viral metagenomes and the software is applicable for other metagenomic analyses as well. ViraPipe integrates parallel BWA-MEM read aligner, MegaHit De novo assembler, and BLAST and HMMER3 sequence search tools. We show the scalability of ViraPipe by running experiments on mining virus related genomes from NGS datasets in a distributed Spark computing cluster.ViraPipe analyses 768 human samples in 210 minutes on a Spark computing cluster comprising 23 nodes and 1288 cores in total. The speedup of ViraPipe executed on 23 nodes was 11x compared to the sequential analysis pipeline executed on a single node. The whole process includes parallel decompression, read interleaving, BWA-MEM read alignment, filtering and normalizing of non-human reads, De novo contigs assembling, and searching of sequences with BLAST and HMMER3 tools.https://github.com/NGSeq/ViraPipe}",
